Fake News Prediction Model
Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict fake news using Python, Scikit-learn, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Features
Data collection and preprocessing
Train-test data split
Implementation of a Logistic Regression model
Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
Real-time fake news detection
Steps
1. Data Collection
Collected news data for training and testing.

2. Data Preprocessing
Applied tokenization, stemming, and vectorization techniques to preprocess the news data.

3. Train-Test Split
Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

4. Model Training
Built and trained a Logistic Regression model to classify news as real or fake.

5. Model Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. Real-Time Detection
Deployed the trained model for real-time fake news detection.

Requirements
Python
Scikit-learn
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Pandas
